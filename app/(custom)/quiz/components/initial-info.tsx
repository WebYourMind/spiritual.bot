      For this assessment, we aim to understand your natural way of thinking. This isn&apos;t about what you strive to
      do but rather how you inherently process information and respond to situations, akin to being right or
      left-handed.
    </p>
    <p>

      Heart, and the interplay of How and What.
    </p>
    <p>
      Initially, we&apos;ll determine your dominant style with broad questions, then we&apos;ll delve deeper for a more
      nuanced understanding.
